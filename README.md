# Truco Game

Welcome to Truco, a fun and engaging card game! This project allows you to play Truco online with your friends.

## How to Play

1.  **Start a New Game:** When you first open the application, you'll see a button to "Create New Game." Click this to begin.
2.  **Invite Players:** After creating a game, four QR codes will appear. Your friends can scan these QR codes with their phones to join your game.
3.  **Set Your Name:** Once a player scans a QR code, they will be prompted to enter their name and then wait for the game to start.
4.  **Game On!** Once all players are ready, the game will begin. The "Dinner" (game master/dealer) will distribute cards, set the main card, and start the rounds.
5.  **Play Cards:** Players will take turns playing cards in each round.
6.  **Win Rounds and Games:** The goal is to win rounds to ultimately win the entire game!

Get ready for some exciting Truco action!
